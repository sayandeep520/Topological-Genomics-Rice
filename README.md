# Topological-Genomics-Rice
By modeling 3,000 rice genomes as a high-dimensional manifold, this study uncovers a persistent topological loop connecting *Indica* and *Japonica*. Validated by AI and GWAS, this evolutionary "bridge" maps to the *Saltol* locus, proving that ancient hybridization preserved critical salinity-tolerance traits in specific landraces like ARC 7263.
